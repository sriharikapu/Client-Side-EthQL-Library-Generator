Detailed Project Description (no more than 3-4 sentences)
Run a command to generate an apollo-client based library for interacting with EthQL which includes human friendly client-side handling of contracts.

buidl --contracts ./contracts --output ./build
{
  CryptoKitties {
    totalSupply
    ownerOf(id: 1337) {
      address
      balance
    }
  }
}
(NB: the join-like feature for getting info about the owner above is not quite implemented yet! But very much doable in more time)

Describe your tech stack (e.g., protocols, languages, API’s, etc.)
JavaScript throughout, generator uses ABI parser from Tailor, generated library uses apollo-client GraphQL library with SchemaLink middleware to intercept and transform queries - an entire GQL execution environment included!
